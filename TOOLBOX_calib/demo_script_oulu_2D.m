% This demo script runs our calibration engine on Heikkil?'s data (2D rigs)
% available at: http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~jth/calibr/
% This code loads the data from the format available on his web site, converts
% in my data format, runs the main calibration engine, displays the results and saves
% the results into a file called Calib_Results.mat

% Preparing the data:

clear;

load cademo,

n_ima = 3;

x_1 = data1(:,4:5)';
X_1 = data1(:,1:3)';
x_2 = data2(:,4:5)';
X_2 = data2(:,1:3)';

% Image size: (may or may not be available)

nx = 500;
ny = 500;

% No calibration image is available (only the corner coordinates)

no_image = 1;

% Set the toolbox not to prompt the user (choose default values)

dont_ask = 1;

% Run the main calibration routine:

go_calib_optim;

% Shows the extrinsic parameters:

ext_calib;

% Reprojection on the original images:

reproject_calib;

% Set the toolbox to normal mode of operation again:

dont_ask =  0;
